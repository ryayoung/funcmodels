# `@openai_function`

## Highlights

This documentation assumes you're already familiar with OpenAI function calling, **_and_** Pydantic BaseModel.

```py
from typing import Literal

@openai_function
def get_stock_price(ticker: str, currency: Literal["USD", "EUR"] = "USD"):
    """
    Get the stock price of a company, by ticker symbol

    Parameters
    ----------
    ticker
        The ticker symbol of the company
    currency
        The currency to use
    """
    return f"182.41 {currency}, -0.48 (0.26%) today"


get_stock_price
```
```
OpenaiFunction({
    "name": "get_stock_price",
    "description": "Get the stock price of a company, by ticker symbol",
    "parameters": {
        "properties": {
            "ticker": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The ticker symbol of the company"
            },
            "currency": {
                "default": "USD",
                "enum": [
                    "USD",
                    "EUR"
                ],
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The currency to use"
            }
        },
        "required": [
            "ticker"
        ],
        "type": "object"
    }
})
```

`@openai_function` dynamically creates a custom `pydantic.BaseModel` class with:
- Your function's parameters as attributes, for validation
- Class attribute, `schema`, with an OpenAI Function object for your function
    - Parses docstring for description, and parameter descriptions, if present.
    - Type structure based on pydantic's `.model_json_schema()`
- Class method, `.from_json()` to easily instantiate your model from raw JSON arguments received from OpenAI
- A `.__call__()` method to easily call your original function, using the model's validated attributes.

---

#### Get our OpenAI function definition dictionary
```py
get_stock_price.schema
```
```
{'name': 'get_stock_price', 'description': 'Get the stock price of a company, by ticker symbol', 'parameters': {'properties': {'ticker': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The ticker symbol of the company'}, 'currency': {'default': 'USD', 'enum': ['USD', 'EUR'], 'type': 'string', 'description': 'The currency to use'}}, 'required': ['ticker'], 'type': 'object'}}
```

#### Instantiate our pydantic model, validating arguments

```py
model = get_stock_price(ticker="AAPL")
```

#### Or, go directly from raw json arguments from OpenAI

```py
raw_arguments_from_openai = '{"ticker": "AAPL"}'
model = get_stock_price.from_json(raw_arguments_from_openai)
model.currency
```
```
'USD'
```

#### Call our function, with already-validated arguments
```py
model()
```
```
'182.41 USD, -0.48 (0.26%) today'
```

### If you prefer Pydantic syntax, we can achieve the *same* thing using `Field`s

```py
from pydantic import Field

@openai_function
def get_stock_price(
    ticker: str = Field(description="The ticker symbol of the company"),
    currency: Literal["USD", "EUR"] = Field("USD", description="The currency to use."),
):
    "Get the stock price of a company, by ticker symbol"
    return f"182.41 {currency}, -0.48 (0.26%) today"
```

Here, the field descriptions are defined in the parameters themselves, rather than the docstring.

The result is the exact same function definition as before:
```py
get_stock_price
```
```
OpenaiFunction({
    "name": "get_stock_price",
    "description": "Get the stock price of a company, by ticker symbol",
    "parameters": {
        "properties": {
            "ticker": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The ticker symbol of the company"
            },
            "currency": {
                "default": "USD",
                "enum": [
                    "USD",
                    "EUR"
                ],
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The currency to use"
            }
        },
        "required": [
            "ticker"
        ],
        "type": "object"
    }
})
```

# Function Groups

```py
def get_stock_price(ticker: str):
    return '182.41 USD, -0.48 (0.26%) today'

def get_weather(city: str):
    return "Sunny, 72 degrees, 0% chance of rain"

group = openai_function_group(functions=[get_stock_price, get_weather])
group
```
```
OpenaiFunctionGroup([
    {
        "name": "get_stock_price",
        "parameters": {
            "properties": {
                "ticker": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "ticker"
            ],
            "type": "object"
        }
    },
    {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "parameters": {
            "properties": {
                "city": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "city"
            ],
            "type": "object"
        }
    }
])
```

> Note: Use `group.function_definitions` to get a list of the raw function schemas to use in the `functions` argument to OpenAI

#### Now, when we get a function call from OpenAI, we can let the group handle it.
```py
function_call_from_openai = {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "arguments": '{"city": "Denver"}',
}

model = group.evaluate_function_call(function_call_from_openai)
model
```
```
get_weather(city='Denver')
```

```py
result = model()
result
```
```
'Sunny, 72 degrees, 0% chance of rain'
```


# Create your own ChatGPT

Because each `@openai_function` encapsulates all the information needed to facilitate OpenAI function calling, it's
very easy for us to build our own ChatGPT, with **automated function call handling**.

## Step 1. Define conversation handler

```py
import json
from dataclasses import dataclass
from openai import OpenAI
from openai.types.chat.chat_completion import Choice
from funcmodels import OpenaiFunctionGroup, openai_function_group


@dataclass
class ChatGPTConversation:
    model: str
    client: OpenAI
    functions: OpenaiFunctionGroup
    messages: list[dict]

    def get_openai_response(self) -> Choice:
        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            messages=self.messages,
            model=self.model,
            functions=self.functions.function_definitions,
            function_call="auto",
        )
        return response.choices[0]

    def add_message(self, message: dict):
        print(json.dumps(message, indent=4))
        self.messages.append(message)

    def chat(self):
        result = self.get_openai_response()
        self.add_message(result.message.model_dump(exclude_unset=True))

        if (function_call := result.message.function_call) is not None:
            output = self.functions.evaluate_function_call(function_call)()
            self.add_message(dict(role="function", name=function_call.name, content=str(output)))

            if result.finish_reason == 'function_call':
                self.chat()

    def send_message(self, prompt: str):
        self.add_message({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
        self.chat()
```

> Here, `chat()` is a recursive function that continues sending API requests
for as long as the response's `finish_reason='function_call'`.

## Step 2. Define openai functions
```py
def get_stock_price(ticker: str):
    "Get the stock price of a company, by ticker symbol."
    return "182.41 USD, âˆ’0.48 (0.26%) today"

def get_weather(city: str):
    "Get the current weather in a city."
    return "Sunny and 75 degrees"

def get_current_datetime(city: str):
    "Get the current date and time in a city."
    return "Friday, Nov. 10, 2023, 10:00 AM"

group = openai_function_group(functions=[get_stock_price, get_weather, get_current_datetime])
group
```
```
OpenaiFunctionGroup([
    {
        "name": "get_stock_price",
        "description": "Get the stock price of a company, by ticker symbol.",
        "parameters": {
            "properties": {
                "ticker": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "ticker"
            ],
            "type": "object"
        }
    },
    {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get the current weather in a city.",
        "parameters": {
            "properties": {
                "city": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "city"
            ],
            "type": "object"
        }
    },
    {
        "name": "get_current_datetime",
        "description": "Get the current date and time in a city.",
        "parameters": {
            "properties": {
                "city": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "city"
            ],
            "type": "object"
        }
    }
])
```

## Step 3. Create a new conversation
```py
chatgpt = ChatGPTConversation(
    model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
    client=OpenAI(api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]),
    functions=group,
    messages=[
        dict(role="system", content="You are a helpful AI assistant."),
    ]
)
```

## Step 4. Exchange messages

**You'll need to use Jupyter notebooks (or interactive terminal) for this**

```py
chatgpt.send_message("Hello, how are you?")
```
```
{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Hello, how are you?"
}
{
    "content": "Hello! I'm just a machine, so I don't have feelings, but I'm functioning optimally. How can I assist you today?",
    "role": "assistant"
}
```

```py
chatgpt.send_message(
    "I'm enjoying my breakfast here in Denver. Can you list 3 fun things to do here, "
    "then give me a quick morning update with the information available?"
)
```
```
{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "I'm enjoying my breakfast here in Denver. Can you list 3 fun things to do here, then give me a quick morning update with the information available?"
}
{
    "content": "Of course! Here are three fun activities to do in Denver:\n\n1. **Visit the Denver Botanic Gardens**: Enjoy a peaceful morning walking through the various plant collections and exhibits. It's a good way to appreciate nature and the diverse plant life.\n\n2. **Explore the Denver Art Museum**: With its wide range of art from across the world, including contemporary, indigenous, and classic pieces, this museum offers a rich cultural experience.\n\n3. **Take a Stroll Around Larimer Square**: This historic district is perfect for a leisurely walk, as you can explore boutique shops, enjoy local eateries, and take in the unique architecture and vibrant atmosphere.\n\nNow, let's get you that morning update for Denver:\n\nI can provide you with the current weather, the current date and time, and check on the stock price of a company if you're following any in particular.

    "role": "assistant",
    "function_call": {
        "arguments": "{\"city\":\"Denver\"}",
        "name": "get_weather"
    }
}
{
    "role": "function",
    "name": "get_weather",
    "content": "Sunny and 75 degrees"
}
{
    "content": null,
    "role": "assistant",
    "function_call": {
        "arguments": "{\"city\":\"Denver\"}",
        "name": "get_current_datetime"
    }
}
{
    "role": "function",
    "name": "get_current_datetime",
    "content": "Friday, Nov. 10, 2023, 10:00 AM"
}
{
    "content": "Here's your morning update for Denver:\n\n- **Weather:** It's currently sunny and 75 degrees in Denver. It seems like a beautiful day to enjoy any of the outdoor activities I mentioned!\n- **Current Date and Time:** It's Friday, November 10, 2023, and the time is 10:00 AM.\n\nIf there's a particular stock you'd like to check on, just let me know the ticker symbol, and I'll get the latest price for you. Have a fantastic day enjoying Denver!",
    "role": "assistant"
}
```

#### If we stitch together the `content` of each *assistant* message (2nd and last messages), we get a continuous block of response text:
